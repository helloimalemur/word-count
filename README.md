# word-count

## This is a work in progress!

## A writer's Word count application.
#### Supports Windows, MacOS, and Linux
    For keeping track of the word-count in multiple .docx files at the same time.
    While also providing additional information.

## Installation downloads
### [Windows](https://github.com/helloimalemur/word-count/releases/tag/windows)
    The Windows installer does not yet create a shortcut to launch the application.
    You can find the executeable at: C:\ProgramFiles\word-count\bin\word-count 

### [MacOS](https://github.com/helloimalemur/word-count/releases/tag/macos)
    Download, and extract the archive.
    The .app installer can be dragged from `<archive>/target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/bundle/osx/` to your Applications folder.

    note: This app is not registered in the Apple Developer program, so you will need to grant an exception for the app.
        You can allow an already blocked app by clicking the 'Open Anyway' button in Privacy & Security settings.

### [Linux](https://github.com/helloimalemur/word-count/releases/tag/linux)
    Installation on Linux is as simple as extracting the archive and running;
    sudo dpkg -i target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/bundle/deb/word-count_<version>_amd64.deb

## Development
#### you will need to install Rust
    https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
#### Then Clone the repo
#### Run the following in a command prompt.
    git clone https://github.com/helloimalemur/word-count.git;
    cd word-count/;
    cargo run;           # build and run

##### Notes
    Removes unicode em-dashes (u+2014) prior to calculating word count, so "backâ€”then" would correctly calculate as two words.

### Current calculations provided
    word count
    unique words

### Planned calculations
    average sentance count per paragraph
    average character count per paragraph
    top three sentance starter words


## Development and Collaboration
#### Feel free to open a pull request, please run the following prior to your submission please!
    echo "Run clippy"; cargo clippy -- -D clippy::all
    echo "Format source code"; cargo fmt -- --check

### Misc
    Why the dialogs look ugly/blurry on Windows?
    
    Turn on crate features or embed manifests into the .exe to enable visual styling and dpi awareness for your program. Check out examples/windows_manifest and examples/windows_features for example.
    Why the program crashed when opening a dialog on macOS?
    
    The UI framework of macOS (Cocoa) has a limitation that all UI operations must be performed on the main thread.
    Linux dependencies
    
    The Linux implementation of native-dialog requires either Zenity or Kdialog to be installed. Otherwise you'll get a No Implementation error.
